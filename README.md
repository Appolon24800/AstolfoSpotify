# AstolfoSpotify
## A spotify player for Astolfo client using zarscript2 and Flask

How to use?: Download the file "backend.exe", you can probably rewrite it for Linux / MacOS but Astolfo client only support windows.
             Run it and open the '.env' file
             Everything you will have to do is in the '.env' file.

I don't want to use the compiled version:
             If you don't want to use the compiled build, you can still use the source.
             For that, you need to install python and pip
             After that, open the CMD (window + R and type "cmd.exe")
             You will have to execute some commands now:
                          - "pip install flask[async]"
                          - "pip install dotenv_python"
                          - "pip install spotipy"

I compiled it and its not the same size
             Its normal, I used something called UPX
